# IDA-ICE Energy Simulation Dataset

> ⚠️ **Synthetic Data Disclaimer**: This dataset contains **synthetically generated data** for demonstration and testing purposes. It does not represent real IDA-ICE simulation outputs or actual building energy consumption.

## Overview

Annual energy simulation results in the style of IDA-ICE (Indoor Climate and Energy) software. Includes monthly breakdowns for heating, cooling, lighting, and equipment energy consumption.
